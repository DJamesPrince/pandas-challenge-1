# Module 4 Challenge - Pandas Analysis

This repository contains the work completed for the Module 4 Challenge, focusing on data analysis with Python's Pandas library. This challenge simulates a real-world scenario where we explore, analyze, and draw insights from a dataset provided by a fictional e-commerce company.

## Background

The challenge serves as a hands-on exercise in practical data analysis, allowing us to practice examining, cleaning, processing, and extracting valuable information from large datasets. Throughout this task, we identify top customers, popular product categories, calculate profits, and delve into other analytical queries that mimic real-world business data tasks.

## Files

Then navigate to the notebook file and run the cells.

## Exploration and Transformation
The project is divided into parts that explore and transform the dataset:

Explore the Data: Import the data, view column names, gather statistics, and answer key questions about the dataset.

Transform the Data: Create additional columns to calculate subtotals, shipping prices, taxes, costs, and profits.

Confirm Your Work: Verify the calculations against provided order receipts.

Summarize and Analyze: Generate summary statistics for the top 5 clients and write a brief summary of the findings.
